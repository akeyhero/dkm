## Repertoire Classification Problem

To demonstrate that *dynamic kernel matching* (DKM) can be used to classify sets of sequences, we modify a logistic regression model with DKM and fit it to the repertoire classification dataset [(link)](https://github.com/jostmey/dkm/tree/master/repertoire-classification-problem/dataset). To handle sets of sequences, we apply DKM twice, first to handle the sequences and then again to handle the set. We handle sequences using the code from the antigen classification problem, and we handle the sets by taking the maximum scoring sequence.

## Fitting Procedure

Two special aspects for fitting the model are (i) gradient aggregation and (ii) many local minima.

###### Gradient Aggregation
Each sequenced immune repertoire contains an average of over 100,000 receptors with almost 10,000,000 features per sample. Consequently, only one or a few immune repertoires fit into GPU memory at any given time. To fit the model to the training data, we rely on gradient aggregation, which is where the gradients with respect to the cross-entropy loss function are computed one sample at a time in a serial fashion. Afterwards, the gradients are added together and the weights are updated. Gradient aggregation achieves the same computation as if the gradients are computed over all the samples simultaneously, as is commonly done.


###### Many Local Minima
After running 128 steps of gradient optimization, we observe that the fit strongly depends on initial weight values. If we refit the model using different initial weight values, we get a substantially different result. This indicates the loss landscape contains many local minimum. To attempt to find a global minimum, we refit the model 16 x 8 = 128 times, each time starting from different initial weight values. Then we use the weights from the best fit, as measured over the training cohort. At this stage, the validation and test cohorts are still untouched.

*We anticipate that by taking the best fit from a significantly larger number of copies, like 1024 copies, that better classification results can be obtained.*

## Running the model(s)

Running `train_val.py` simultaneously fits 16 copies of the model to the training cohort. We run the script 8 times, resulting in a total of 128 copies of the model. We find the best fit to the training cohort out of all 128 copies. The initialization of the model can take 15 minutes or more before gradient optimization begins. Our setup assumes an array of 8 GPUs with the same memory as a P100 16GB GPU.

```

```

A separate script identifies the copy that best fits the training cohort, which also reports how that copy does on the validation cohort.

```
python3 find_bestfit.py
```

The seven columns of numbers report:
1. The gradient optimization step,
2. script run with best fitting copy (1 to 8),
3. index of the best fitting copy on sed run (0 to 15),
4. the cross-entropy loss over the training cohort for the best fitting copy,
5. the classification accuracy over training cohort for sed copy,
6. the cross-entropy loss over the validation cohort for sed copy,
7. and the classification accuracy over validation cohort for sed copy,

Once the best fitting copy has been identified, we can evaluate that copy of the model on the test cohort. Suppose the best fitting script run is 1 and the best fitting copy on that run is 14.

```
python3 test.py --gpu 0 --database ../dataset/database.h5 --cohort_test Cohort_II --split_test samples --input bin/model_1 --index 14 --output bin/model_1
```

The script reports the cross-entropy loss and the classification accuracy over the test cohort. We achieved a classification accuracy of 67.6%. Given that we balance over the two possible outcomes, the baseline accuracy achievable by chance is 1/2, or equivalent to tossing a coin. While these results are poor, we planned to use confidence cutoffs from the onset of this study, allowing us to achieve significantly better results with a caveat. See the next section.

## Confidence Cutoffs

To provide predictions relevant to clinical decision making, we use a simple approach for capturing only those samples classified with high confidence, separating these samples from indeterminate cases that require additional observation and diagnostic testing. By providing an indeterminate diagnosis on uncertain cases, only the patients that can be diagnosed with a high degree of confidence receive a diagnosis, resulting in a higher classification accuracy. When conducting a blindfolded study, the labels for uncaptured samples must remain blindfolded. The classification accuracy is calculated only from the unblindfolded samples captured by the cutoffs.

To begin, we run every sample through the statistical classifier to generate a prediction. Each prediction represents a probability distribution over outcomes, allowing us to calculate the entropy associated with each prediction. Let `H_j` represent the entropy from the prediction for sample j. We define `H_cutoff` as the cutoff for capturing samples. If `H_j ≤ H_cutoff` the sample is captured because the confidence is high. Otherwise, the sample is not captured by the cutoff because the confidence is low. We start with a value for `H_cutoff` large enough to ensure all the samples are initially captured and decrease `H_cutoff` in increments of 0.01 until we find that the accuracy over captured samples is ≥95% on the validation cohort. We then apply the cutoff to capture samples on the blindfolded test cohort and compute the accuracy.

We provide a script to find `H_cutoff`. Suppose the best fitting run is 8 and the best fitting copy on that run is 2.

```
python3 cutoff_finder.py --predictions_val bin/model_1_ps_val.csv --index 14 --output cutoff_finder_results.csv
```

Examine `cutoff_finder_results.csv` and find the value for `H_cutoff` associated with at least a 95% classification accuracy on the validation cohort. This is our cutoff. We are ready to capture samples from the test cohort. Suppose `H_cutoff` is 0.527.

```
python3 cutoff_test.py --predictions_test bin/model_8_ps_test.csv --cutoff 0.527 --index 2 --output cutoff_test_results.csv
```

Examine `cutoff_test_results.csv` for the results. **We achieve a classification accuracy of 96% capturing 18% of samples.** Samples from the test cohort are captured almost evenly across the two categories, CMV+ and CMV-.
