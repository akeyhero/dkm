## Antigen Classification Dataset

10x Genomics has published a dataset of sequenced T-cell receptors labelled by antigen that we refer to as the antigen classification dataset
[(link)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/application-notes/a-new-way-of-exploring-immunity-linking-highly-multiplexed-antigen-recognition-to-immune-repertoire-and-phenotype/).
For each T-cell, the V-gene, CDR3 sequence, and J-gene for both the Î±- and Î²-chains of the T-cell provide features characterizing
the receptor. A multimer of barcoded pMHCs is sequenced with each T-cell to determine if any of the pMHCs interact with the T-cell
receptor, providing the labels. 

Samples have been built from this dataset and split into a training, validation, and test cohort. The samples are stored in a [HDF5 file](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/)
under
`database.h5`.

## Rebuilding the Dataset

The scripts to reconstruct the samples are provided in this folder. Because the last script randomly shuffles the samples, reconstructing the database will result in different splits of the data (i.e. the training, validation, and test cohorts will not necessarily be the same).
